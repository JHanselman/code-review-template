% To do so, replace the part behind  \textbf{bolded text:} & &  
%
% Programming languages can contain any langages you used as well as version information (if relevant), for example

\section{Importance of software in the paper}
%====================
% Importance
%====================

%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 5 of 12)

% Here you can indicate the role the code plays in the paper. Depending on what this is the focus of the review might be a bit different.  
% Common roles are:
% - The paper explains a new algorithm capable of computing things we were not able to compute before
% - The paper presents an algorithm that is claimed to be better than existing algorithms
% - The paper discusses a database of mathematical objects
% - The code is used to compute examples included in the paper
% - The code is used to do computations as part of a proof

% But it isn't necesarry to stick to one of these descriptions

%====================
%====================

The repository contains the implementation of the algorithms and the results of the computations described in the paper.\\  % <- Edit this

\section{Reproducibility (Installation)}
%====================
% Installation
%====================

%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 6 of 12)

% Here everything that has to with with installing the software can be written. 
% To do so, replace the text next to "% <- Edit this"
% To use the symbols (blue plus for a positive aspect, red minus for a negative minus) you can comment out their respective lines with %.

%====================
%====================
% 

\begin{tabular}[t]{p{15 em} p{1em} p{35em}} 
\textbf{License:}  & & 
%\mplus

No license found\\  % <- Edit this

\textbf{Availability: }& & 
\mplus 
%\mminus

\textbf{Installation:} & & 
\mplus

\end{tabular}


\section{Installation steps taken}
%====================
% Installation Steps
%====================

%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 7 of 12)

% Here you describe what steps you took to try to install the software. This can be especially helpful for the authors when you fail to install the software as it may allow them to reproduce the problem and fix it. 
% To do so, edit add an \item in the itemized environment for every step you took.

% If there are multiple pieces of software included in the paper, you can split the installation steps into separate parts and label them, e.g.

%\textbf{Magma Code:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
%\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Sage Code:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
%\item Step 3
%\end{itemize}

%====================
%====================
% 

\textbf{Code:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cloned \verb|https://github.com/MaRDItheMathbunny/MaRDICode| from GitHub  
%\item  Step 2
%\item Step 3
%\item  etc.
\end{itemize} % <- Edit this

\section{Reproducibility (Records of setup)}
%====================
% Records of setup
%====================


%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 8 of 12)

% Here you write down whether the authors wrote down the specs of their system or OS that they used to produce their results. This is more important when the authors have code that takes a long time to run or when they compare their algorithm with other algorithms.
% To do so, replace the text next to "% <- Edit this"
% To use the symbols (blue plus for a positive aspect, red minus for a negative minus) you can comment out their respective lines with %.

%====================
%====================
% 



\begin{tabular}[t]{p{15 em} p{1em} p{35em}}
\textbf{Specification of CPU:}& & 
%\mplus
\mminus 
Did not find what CPU was used. \\  % <- Edit this

\textbf{Specification of Memory:}& & 
%\mplus
\mminus 
Did not find the amount of memory used. \\  % <- Edit this

\textbf{Specification of OS/software used:}& & 
%\mplus
\mminus 
Did not find which Magma version was used. \\  % <- Edit this

\textbf{References and citation: }& & 
\mplus 
%\mminus 
Magma is cited. The other packages the software builds on or depends on are properly cited.\\  % <- Edit this

\section{Reproducibility (Running the code)}
%====================
% Reproducibility
%====================

%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 9 of 12)

% % Here you describe whether you were able to run the code that was provided. You can furthermore mention any errors that showed up.

% To do so, replace the text next to "% <- Edit this"

% To quote error messages or parts of the code one could use the verbatim environment:  \begin{verbatim} CODE \end{verbatim}
% To use the symbols (blue plus for a positive aspect, red minus for a negative minus) you can comment out their respective lines with %.

% If there are multiple pieces of software included in the paper, you can split the evaluation of the reproducibililty into separate parts and label them, e.g.

%\textbf{Magma Code:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
%\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Sage Code:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
%\item Step 3
%\end{itemize}

%====================
%====================
% 

\begin{tabular}[t]{p{15 em} p{1em} p{35em}}

\textbf{Code:} & & 
\mplus 
%\mminus 
The code seems to run fine. It does give a small error however: \begin{verbatim}
In file "Carrot.m", line 587, column 9:
>> bunny := [ 0, 0, 0];
\end{verbatim}\\ % <- Edit this

\end{tabular}

\section{Correctness and Reliability}
%====================
% Correctness and Reliability
%====================

%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 10 of 12)

% In this section you can indicate how convinced you are that the code does what is claimed in the paper. Things that might make results more convincing are, for example, trying out different inputs, test files written by the authos or multiple implementations in different systems. But these are not strictly necessary. This section is mostly about if the output coincides with what was claimed and if the algorithms seem to be doing the correct thing.

% To do so, replace the text next to "% <- Edit this"

% To quote error messages or parts of the code one could use the verbatim environment:  \begin{verbatim} CODE \end{verbatim}
% To use the symbols (blue plus for a positive aspect, red minus for a negative minus) you can comment out their respective lines with %.

% If there are multiple examples or calculations included in the paper, you can split the evaluation of the correctness into separate parts and label them, e.g.

%\textbf{Lemma 5.3:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
%\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Polynomials in section 6:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
%\item Step 3
%\end{itemize}

%====================
%====================
% 


\begin{tabular}[t]{p{15 em} p{1em} p{35em}}
\textbf{Recalculating the examples:} & & 
%\mplus
\mminus 
I find it a bit hard to check whether the code produces the same results as what the authors got. There are a lot of files in the Github and it was unclear to me what files I should look at. \\ % <- Edit this

\section{Readability}
%====================
% Readability
%====================

%====================
%====================
% FOR REVIEWERS TO FILL OUT (PART 11 of 12)

% In this section you describe whether the code looks easy to read. Are variable names chosen in a meaningful way? Is the code properly indented?, etc.

% To do so, replace the text next to "% <- Edit this"

% To use the symbols (blue plus for a positive aspect, red minus for a negative minus) you can comment out their respective lines with %.

% If there are multiple pieces of software included in the paper, you can split the evaluation of the readability into separate parts and label them, e.g.

%\item Step 1
%\item  Step 2
