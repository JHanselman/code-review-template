% Correctness and Reliability
%====================
% In this section you can indicate how convinced you are that the code does what is claimed in the paper. Thinks that might make results more convincing are, for example, trying out different inputs, test files written by the authos or multiple implementations in different systems. But these are not strictly necessary. This section is mostly about if the output coincides with what was claimed and if the algorithms seem to be doing the correct thing.

\textbf{Recalculating the examples:} & & \mminus I find it a bit hard to check whether the code produces the same results as what the authors got. There are a lot of files in the Github and it was unclear to me what files I should look at.
